We’re thrilled to share that **Lewis Ford** has joined Ologist as our Chief Operations Officer.

Lewis brings a sharp eye for organisational complexity and a deep background in programme delivery,
business analysis, and enterprise architecture. He’s worked across sectors — from health tech
to retail — helping large teams cut through the noise and deliver real results.

Most recently, Lewis was a Principal Consultant at Aire Logic, where he focused on enterprise
architecture and interoperability for public sector clients. Before that, he led delivery teams
and business analysis efforts across a wide range of digital transformation projects.

At Ologist, we help institutions of all sizes tackle messy, mission-critical problems
— and Lewis joining us marks a big step forward in that mission. He’ll be helping us scale our practice,
sharpen our delivery approach, and keep us laser-focused on doing work that matters.

> “I care about building great teams, cutting through complexity, and delivering work that
actually makes a difference,” says Lewis. “That’s exactly what Ologist is about, and I’m excited to
help us do it at scale.”

We’re lucky to have him. Welcome aboard, Lewis.
