## Overview

Our partner organisation Perform Partners reached out to Ologist to provide transformation services around the University of Sheffield\'s legacy Oracle application stack, and large non-managed codebase of over 100 applications.

Working with the IT Services department, over the course of 12-months, we designed long-term cultural patterns that the University could progressively adopt across their vast software estate to deal with systemic cultural and technical problems.

Ologist also took the lead on a comprehensive training and knowledge-transfer project, upskilling key members of the University's team and bringing them up to speed with our ways of working. Targetting key personnel, we were able to maximise our impact within the organisation.
