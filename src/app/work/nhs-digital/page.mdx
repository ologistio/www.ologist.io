## Overview

The Digital arm of the National Health Service has a promising track-record of pushing the envelope of HealthTech; in 2021, Ologist were approached to help work on their flagship API Platform project.

NHS Digital's API Platform would become the front-door to health and care APIs throughout NHS England and beyond; providing NHS Partners and clinician-technologists access to point-of-care and patient care functions through a single unified platform.

Ologist engineers, working alongside other partners in a consortium, designed scaleable infrastructure across both Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform; including a large Function-as-a-Service Middleware system, integration with NHS Login and NHS Care Identity Service, and the development of workflows for deploying APIs and documentation from OpenAPI Specifications.

Our work saw the API Platform move from a prototype service in late 2020, to a Live service with over a thousand active developers and over 120 APIs.

  Working with the NHS in the peak of Covid-19 was an absolute privilege. In 
  helping our health service build open, mature APIs, we got to work closely with
  clinicians, support staff and NHS Partners to build something incredible.
